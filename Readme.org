* Core concepts

** Definition
#+begin_quote
Design tokens are design properties stored as variables that help
create themeable user interfaces.
#+end_quote

#+begin_src css
  /* From */
  button {
      background-color: #aabbcc;
  }
  /* To */
  button {
      background-color: var(--ds-theme-color-background-brand);
  }
#+end_src

** Workflow
Creating a button, or updating the color and font:
- Plan :: define work to be done
- Design :: visual/UX design, create assets in design tool
- Review :: review with stakeholders, make some rounds of back and
  forth
- Build :: create HTML, CSS, and JS, create component API
- Test & QA :: a11y, content, functionality, responsive,
  cross-browser/device, i18n, unit tests, visual regression tests,
  stories, code review, design review
- Publish :: make the component available
- Adopt :: consuming app imports component, wires up to product
  context/content/backend/etc..
- Launch :: app publishes product work with component
- Maintain :: bug fixes, style tweaks, post-launch changes

** Separation of concerns
Before, it was just about:
- HTML :: structure of the document
- CSS :: style of the document
- JS :: behaviour of the document

Now, it's more *component system* vs *design token*
- Component system:
  - HTML :: Structure
  - CSS :: Structural style
  - JS :: Behaviour
- Design token
  - CSS :: Aesthetic style

** Design tokens properties
Design tokens are the design decisions stored in variables. They are
style properties stored as variables and serve as the implementation
agnostic source of truth for a design language.
They can be:
|--------------------+-----------------+---------------------|
| colour             | typography      | other               |
|--------------------+-----------------+---------------------|
| background colours | font properties | border properties   |
| text colours       | line propertios | shadows             |
| border colours     | letter spacing  | size/spacing values |
| icon colours       | text transforms | animation values    |
|--------------------+-----------------+---------------------|
